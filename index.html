      <h2> Course Description </h2>
      Proof assistants are software tools based on logic. 
      They are typically used in both mathematics and computer science to verify proofs of theorems (in mathematics) or algorithm correctness (in CS). 
      Beginning texts often emphasize mathematical applications focused on logic, while typical undergraduate mathematics education does not. 
      The corpora of mathematics results for many proof assistants are heavily slanted towards real analysis and abstract algebra, but have limited depth in topology 
      and geometry. Students will learn to use the Isabelle proof assistant to initially do some proofs covering introductory material in a Calculus book, 
      and then move on to study both real and synthetic projective geometry, leading up to showing every Desarguesian projective plane admits coordinates 
      in some division ring. They'll also complete final projects in some geometry-related topic.

    <h2> Syllabus & Course Access Links </h2>
     <p> The syllabus can be accessed
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cdK1wn0qhROvsOMf143NUE6tBIVjlEBRUMjalL9DkRI" >
         here.
      </a> The EdStem page is located <a href = "https://edstem.org/us/courses/85072"> here. </a> </p>
    <p> We will use Zoom to facilitate lecture recordings and to allow students to present their work in class conveniently. The Zoom link is posted on EdStem, and
        lecture recordings will be uploaded to Panopto. 
        Please note that credit for in-person attendance and participation represents a significant portion of your course grade. Attending virtually
        is not an acceptable substitute.
    </p>
    <p> Note that grades for individual assignments will be posted on Gradescope. Please contact the course staff if you do not have access to Gradescope. </p>
    <p> We will not be using Canvas for this class.  All course information will be posted here or on EdStem. </p>
